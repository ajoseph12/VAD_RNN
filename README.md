# Voice Activity Detection using RNNs

- The main file is a python notebook, so this should be opened using jupyter.
- To successfully run the notebook, you'll need to download the audio data from https://s3.amazonaws.com/snips/challenge/vad_data.tar.gz and place it in the 'Audio_data' folder.
- I have already added the original background - present in the path 'Audio_data/Background/background_original/' so no worries about that.
